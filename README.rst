City Dump is a city-guessing game that integrates the Google Places API and Google Place Details API. Pulling from a list of major cities around the world, the two API's work together and return a random image of the city in the background. On the front-end, the user will then choose from a multiple choice selection which city they believe the photo to be taken from. The user can immediately see if they picked the correct choice. The final score is output at the end.
